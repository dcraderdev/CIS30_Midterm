Using the IDE of your choice, please complete the following programming questions, upload your code to GitHub, and submit the link to Canvas.

Each question is worth 25 points:

20 points proper syntax, error handling, and implementation of question

5 points functioning code with expected results


Question 1: File Processing and Data Analysis

Outline:

· Read data from a text file.

· Parse the data to extract relevant information.

· Perform calculations (e.g., averages, counts).

· Write the results to a new file.

Question: Write a Python program that reads a text file named grades.txt, where each line contains a student's name followed by their grade (e.g., Alice 88). The program should:

1. Calculate the average grade.

2. Count the number of students who scored above the average.

3. Write the average and the count of above-average students to a file named results.txt

Tips: to test Question 1, create a file with grades and read it into the IDE.


Question 2: Data Transformation

Outline:

· Read a list of integers.

· Use a for loop to transform the data.

· Calculate and return the results based on transformed data.

Question: Write a Python function called transform_data that accepts a list of integers. The function should:

1. Create a new list containing each integer from the original list squared.

2. Calculate the sum of the squared values.

3. Return both the new list and the sum.

Tips: to test Question 2, call your function and pass in the values
